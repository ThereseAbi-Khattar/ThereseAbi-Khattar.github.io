            <h2>Core Beliefs</h2>
            <p> I am committed to creating inclusive, future-focused learning environments that empower students to develop both technical skills and critical thinking. My teaching is rooted in authenticity, accessibility, and equity, with learning experiences designed to reflect real-world industry practices while supporting a diverse range of learners â€” especially those historically underrepresented in STEM.</p>
            <p>I emphasize student agency through project-based learning, tangible computing, and creative expression, helping students see themselves as capable designers, problem-solvers, and active contributors to the digital world.</p>
            <p>Whether Im teaching HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, multimedia production, or quantum programming, I foster an iterative learning process that builds both confidence and competence.</p>

            <p>I believe education should equip students with both technical skills and the confidence to shape a more ethical, inclusive, and sustainable future.</p>
            <p>As a TAS teacher, I design real-world learning experiences that support diverse learners by embedding culturally responsive pedagogy, accessibility, and environmental awareness.</p>
            <p>I model lifelong learning by engaging with industry and continuously reflecting on my practice.</p>
            <p>My goal is for students to see themselves as capable, creative problem-solvers with the potential to make a meaningful impact.</p>

            <h2>Creating a Supportive Learning Environment</h2>
            <p>Using calming music in the classroom helps create a focused and relaxed atmosphere, particularly during hands-on, project-based tasks with junior students</p>
            <p>This simple strategy supports sensory regulation, enhances concentration, and helps reduce anxiety, contributing to a more inclusive and supportive learning environment.</p>
