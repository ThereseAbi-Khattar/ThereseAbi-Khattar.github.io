            <P>Welcome! My name is Therese Abi-Khattar, I am currently undertaking my studies in a Bachelor of Education (Secondary)/ Bachelor Of Arts (Design and Inovation Technologies). I have Majored in Foodtechnology and Minored in Industrial (Woodwork and Metal work) also in Digital technologies. So far i have completed 3 placements at all 3 types of schools, Independant, Catholic and Public sector. These placements have allowed me to gather a vast range of teaching methods and to really see the difference in the different school sectors and how it might impact a students education.
